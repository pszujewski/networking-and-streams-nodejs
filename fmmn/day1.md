# day 1: command-line

Learn the command-line.

So many reference materials, open source tools, blog posts, and job descriptions
assume command-line proficiency, but the resources for learning the command-line
effectively are scattered and largely unhelpful for people who aren't already
familiar with how to get by in a unix system.

Join James Halliday (substack) as we dive into the command-line. You will:

* Become comfortable with the unix command-line using the bash shell.
* Log in to remote servers to edit files and run commands.
* Edit files with vim, a command-line text editor.
* Search and match patterns using regular expressions.
* Automate command-line tasks with their own shell scripts.
* Administer user permissions and system services.

## schedule

* 08:30 - system check, hello
* 09:00 - commands, input/output, and some history
* 09:30 - directories and files, environment variables, flags
* 10:00 - pipes, redirects, scripts, interpolation
* 10:30 - permissions, signals, job control
* 11:00 - user accounts, ssh, public keys
* 11:30 - screen
* 12:00 - lunch etc
* 13:00 - services, init scripts, cron
* 13:30 - regular expressions, grep, sed
* 14:30 - vim basics and practice
* 16:00 - closing notes and wrap up

We will start out the day by covering basic command-line concepts hands-on.
These skills will build up into more advanced techniques and we will begin to
apply our growing knowledge of the command-line and common utility programs by
writing shell scripts, connecting to remote servers over ssh, and administering
user accounts, permissions, and system services.

After lunch, we will use regular expressions to search for patterns and format
text. We will edit text files on the command-line with vim.

## who is this for?

This workshop is for people who want to become effective at the command-line.
Students should be comfortable computer users, but no programming or prior
command-line experience is required.

If you've recently learned some programming, plan to learn programming soon, or
have been programming for a while but never got around to learning the
command-line and a unix system in depth, this workshop is for you!

## prerequisites

Bring a computer running a unix operating system such as GNU/Linux or MacOSX.

If you have a Windows computer, please install Linux. Most Linux installers will
let you dual boot your computer into both Linux and Windows if you want to keep
Windows around. If you don't know where to start, download Ubuntu from
https://www.ubuntu.com/ and install from a bootable USB stick.
