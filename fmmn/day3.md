# day 3:  leveldb and crypto

Learn about crypto basics and leveldb, a modular database.

Cryptography provides a foundation for secure communications and distributed systems.
LevelDB provides a modular ecosystem to persist and query data in node.js and
the browser. These techniques will let you build completely different kinds of
webapps that are fault tolerant, work offline, and can even replicate p2p.

Join James Halliday (substack) as we dive into crypto fundamentals and leveldb.
You will:

* Sign, verify, and encrypt with libsodium/nacl.
* Use cryptographic hashes to build secure data structures.
* Store data in the browser using IndexedDB wrappers.
* Design modular data schemas over lexicographic keys.
* Build data pipelines for live, streaming data.
* Synchronize data and build indexes using the kappa architecture

All of the content relies on libraries that work in both node.js and the
browser.

## who is this for?

This workshop is for people who are proficient in javascript and want to explore
some advanced concepts and architectures.

If you know your way around node.js or frontend and you want to know how to
build offline-first, secure applications, this workshop is for you!

A knowledge of node.js streams will be beneficial but is not strictly required.
